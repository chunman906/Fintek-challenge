# HTML / CSS code test #
This is a short code test for front-end developers at Fintek Software.

Your goal is to implement the "countSquares" function in "countSquares.js". More details about what the 
function should do can be found in the code comments above the function.

If you open the index.html file, you will see that there are a number of tests which try the countSquares
function with different inputs. If you've successfully implemented the function, all these tests should
be marked as "pass".

We are not just looking at whether your code works or how efficient it is. What's important to us is code quality, for
example how you structure your code, how you name variables, and how code is commented.

Once you're done, please put the file in a zip and send it to us - you should be given the link to do this via email.
